# AppImageKit-Toolbox

The Complete Suite of Tools Provided by the AppImage Project to Build AppImages -- Shipping as a Single AppImage!

The AppImageKit Toolbox ships as an AppImage containing all tools provided by the AppImage project and its contributors. The individual tools are provided as AppImages too (even though you may not recognize them as such at first).

To the outside world it appears as a "multicall binary", similar to the *busybox* suite of tools.

When called without an argument (or with the *`--help`* parameter), it simply prints a help overview page.

At this time it is only built for the x86_64 CPU architecture.
