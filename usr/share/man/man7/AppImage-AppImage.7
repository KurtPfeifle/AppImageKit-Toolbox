.SH Name
.PP
The name of an AppImage can be anything and use all characters which are
legal for filenames.
Giving it the \f[C]\&.AppImage\f[] suffix is simply a convention and not
required.
Users may choose to rename an AppImage as they deem convenient.
(It is completely up to them to be able to identify AppImage files
easily then.)
.PP
AppImages are Linux applications packaged in a "distro agnostic" way so
they can run on a large range of recent and not\-so\-recent Linux
distributions.

The AppImage for ImageMagick ...
.IP "2." 3
An AppImage packager may chose to let the AppImage user access embedded
man pages by some mechanism he implements through a custom
\f[I]AppRun\f[] embedded into the AppImage.
For example he could choose to simply use \f[C]\-\-man\f[] as the first
parameter of AppImage invokation to make the AppRun display the
respective man page embedded.
(See \f[B]\f[C]AppRun(1)\f[]\f[] for more details.)
.SH Main Features
.SH Bugs
.PP
If you find an AppImage which does not work as expected you may contact
the AppImageKit developers as well as the packager of the AppImage (who
in most cases will be completely different entities).
Please provide any info you can collect by applying commands and
parameters as described above to the AppImage giving you problems.
.PP
The reason for your problem frequently lays in a wrong way of packaging,
but it may well be a bug in AppImageKit tools used to build the package.
.PP
The two parties named above may need to cooperate in order to fix it and
make it work for you and your distribution.
.SH IRC
.PP
The AppImage developers can be met online in IRC at Freenode in channel
#AppImage.
.SH Notable Examples
.IP "1." 3
Microsoft uses an AppImage of \f[I]PowerShell\f[] to distribute version
6.0.0.0\-Alpha to Linux users who may be interested to familiarize with
this object\-oriented shell.
.IP "2." 3
The developers of \f[I]Subsurface\f[], an end\-user GUI application for
hobby and professional divers for dive logging, planning and evaluation,
which was started by Linus Torvalds, distribute their Linux releases as
AppImages.
.IP "3." 3
Most Free and Open Source programs which are important to the \f[I]3D
printing community\f[] are available as AppImages.
.IP "4." 3
The \f[I]ImageMagick\f[] developers have recently started to distribute
pre\-built binaries of their most recent versions in the 7.x series as
AppImages.
.IP "5." 3
The \f[I]Nitrux\f[] Linux distribution bases their complete software
center (which allows user to add extra software on their systems) on
AppImages.
.IP "6." 3
The \f[I]Open Build Service\f[] (OBS) allows its users to automatically
build AppImages and provides an easy to use framework with all tools and
dependencies to do so.

.SH Developers
.PP
AppImage as the concept to implement the idea of "One App = One File" is
pursued by Simon Peter (<probono@puredarwin.org>) since 2004 even if at
times under different project names.
The concept builds on the much older design of AppDirs (application
directories), such as is still used in macOS with the \f[C]\&.app\f[]
structure which implements the idea of "One Dir = One App".
AppImages push the envelope and go beyond their ancestors in that they
are compressed into a single file as a filesystem (using SquashFS)
instead of living just in a separate directory.
