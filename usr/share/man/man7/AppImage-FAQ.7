Frequently Asked Questions regarding AppImages, AppImageKit and their
Design & Development
.SH Synopsis
.PP
Many questions \-\- short answers.
.SH Go on!
.PP
\f[B]What is the most important feature of the stuff you guys do?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]So what exactly is an application that is at the same time one file
only?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]And that\[aq]s all? Even when I want to test hundreds of AppImages
and their versions I do not need to have a package manager working for
me?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]What is the special thing about AppImages then?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]How do you boot all these ISO Live systems from a single medium? Is
there any trick we need to know about and you are willing to share with
us?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Is this why I\[aq]ve heard people saying about AppImages:
\f[I]"Build Once, Run Anywhere"\f[]?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Do AppImages ship with a secure sandbox or firewall? You know, in
order to isolate their apps from the system and from other
applications?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Isn\[aq]t this "isolation", "sandboxing" and "firewalling" thing
pretty important nowadays? At least it is all the buzz I keep hearing
about Snap and Flatpak, which seem to be doing pretty well in this area
and seem to be projects competing with you...\f[]
.PP
\f[B]You think package managing systems are not a nice thing to have per
se, but only a \[aq]dirty\[aq] tool?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]You seem to think a deeper change to the software building process
is called for than what it looks at first when you encounter a working
AppImage?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]How does AppImage fit into the picture with Snapcraft and Flatpak
then?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Uff... this is pretty heavy stuff! And this was your answer about
the "isolation" and "firewalling" I asked?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Ok, let me try again. Which external tools can I use for sandboxing
/ firewalling with AppImages then?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Is there a HowTo of running an AppImage inside a sandbox?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]They say that your method to achieve your goal \f[I]"1 app = 1
file"\f[] is leading to bloat. They say, I end up with dozens of
versions of the same library in my file system, where I\[aq]d need only
one! They say, you\[aq]re wasting my precious disk space...\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Waaiiiiit! I do not believe you: what about when the AppImage runs?
It does need to be expanded then, for sure!\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Sorry to have interrupted \-\- but I needed this clarification.
What was your second point again?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]But isn\[aq]t a typical RPM or DEB package also compressed when it
is downloaded and installed? Isn\[aq]t the AppImage advantage here
purely ficticious?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Can you give me an example? One which a lot of Linux people would
be using? How much space does that translate to for, say,
LibreOffice?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]So I can put any AppImage somewhere into my $HOME directory and run
it from there?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]AppImages are only for individual users then? And each one has to
get her/his own copy of an AppImage if they want to use it?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Sounds good so far... But aren\[aq]t you a bit too much obsessed by
your project? Hasn\[aq]t your "one app = one file" principle now become
a little dogma? Won\[aq]t you ever make a compromise about this? Say, I
wanted to integrate my collected AppImages into my desktop...\f[]
.PP
\f[B]What does it do?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]But, but... isn\[aq]t that act of extracting the .desktop and Icon
files a sort of "installation"??\f[]
.PP
\f[B]How do I remove the new menu entries, .desktop and icon files from
the start menu again? (Now we have a case of clutter, I knew it!)\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Where can I get this magic daemon? Sure now I need to find a
package from my distro! What do I do if they don\[aq]t have it?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]In the end, you do not look as dogmatic as I thought...\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Why is there such an inconsistent naming convention with your
tools? Some go with all lowercase, some with CamelCase spelling?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Is there an AppImage AppStore?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Why don\[aq]t you provide your own collection of AppImages? Why
don\[aq]t you run your own AppImage AppStore?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]An example Linux distro which embraces AppImages?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]History\f[]
.PP
\f[B]What are you currently working on? What are you planning for future
work?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Does AppImage have a formal specification?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Where is your Code?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Where can I get in touch with you guys online?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Do you have a Wiki?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Is there a centrally maintained list of available AppImages?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Do you have a Homepage?\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Do you have "job openings"? Which areas are you in need of helping
hands mostly?\f[]
.TP
.B \f[B]Are there man pages about your stuff?\f[]
Soon.

.B \f[B]Developers\f[]
AppImage is developed by Simon Peter and a growing team of contributors.
Simon is also the one who formulated and then pursued the packaging
principle of \f[I]"One App = One File"\f[] since over 13 years already.
And he\[aq]s not looking like he\[aq]s ever willing to make any
compromises on THIS one...
