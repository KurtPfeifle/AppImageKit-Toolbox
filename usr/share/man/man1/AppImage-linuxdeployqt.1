.SS Differences to \f[C]macdeployqt\f[]
.PP
\f[C]linuxdeployqt\f[] is conceptually based on Qt\[aq]s Mac Deployment
Tool (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/osx-deployment.html), \f[C]macdeployqt\f[].
\f[C]macdeployqt\f[] lives in the tools applications of the Qt Toolkit.
\f[C]linuxdeployqt\f[] however has been changed to a slightly different
logic and to other tools needed for Linux.
.IP \[bu] 2
Instead of an \f[C]\&.app\f[] bundle for macOS, this produces an
AppDir (http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/AppDirs.html) for Linux (see
also \f[C]man\ AppImage\-AppDir.man\f[]).
.IP \[bu] 2
Instead of a \f[C]\&.dmg\f[] disk image for macOS, this produces an
AppImage (http://appimage.org/) for Linux.
An AppImage is quite similar to a .dmg but it directly executes the
contained application rather than just opening a window on the desktop
from where the application can be launched with an extra action.
.SH Main Features
.PP
By default \f[C]linuxdeployqt\f[] deploys the same Qt instance which
qmake on the \f[C]$PATH\f[] points to.
The \[aq]\-qmake\[aq] option can be used to point to the qmake
executable to be used instead.
.PP
Plugins related to a Qt library are copied in with the library.
.PP
See the "Deploying Applications on Linux" topic in the AppImageKit Wiki
documentation for more information about deployment on Linux.
